        The road to redemption is long and often ends in failiure. <br>
        It makes one wonder, if there is a point to achieve redemtion, if it's not guaranteed. <br>
        There is nothing more terriying than coming to realization that you have no hope, no redemption. <br>
        Far too many had to go down that path, far too little succeeded in the end. <br>
        However, the majority makes no attempt to walk the path.
